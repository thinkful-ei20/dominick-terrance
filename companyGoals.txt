What company do you work for and why? What factors are most important to you 
(geography, work-life balance, colleagues, industry)?

I would like to work for Google or Apple (mainly because I'm fully aware of all of their technology 
and would love to learn more).  Google is right here in New York, so it's close for me to commute to,
and work-life balance seems to be a breeze as long as I know what I'm doing (not a lot of people
leave Google).  Colleagues, I would have to adapt to the situation and go from there, though I doubt
anyone from this organization (or Apple) will be anything but friendly and helpful.  And as far as the
industry, the world of technology continues to grow, expand, change, and enlighten us to new frontiers; so,
I am always up to the challenge.

I don't really have a target company in mind but as long as there is a good growth mindset culture and a good career later I'm open to a variety of different work settings. 

The most important factors to me are good work-life balance, I've learned I work my best when there is balance and not unrealistic work deadlines/conditions and also have time to have a life outside of work. Having a great team-based environment where there is access to manager level and perhaps even exec level communication channels.
