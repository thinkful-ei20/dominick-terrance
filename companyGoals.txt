What company do you work for and why? What factors are most important to you 
(geography, work-life balance, colleagues, industry)?

I would like to work for Google or Apple (mainly because I'm fully aware of all of their technology 
and would love to learn more).  Google is right here in New York, so it's close for me to commute to,
and work-life balance seems to be a breeze as long as I know what I'm doing (not a lot of people
leave Google).  Colleagues, I would have to adapt to the situation and go from there, though I doubt
anyone from this organization (or Apple) will be anything but friendly and helpful.  And as far as the
industry, the world of technology continues to grow, expand, change, and enlighten us to new frontiers; so,
I am always up to the challenge.
